So I made a map. What do you think?

It was surprisingly straightforward. I used illustrator to draw over an existing map (Kavrayskiy VII map projection for the map nerds amongst) and &#8220;laser&#8221; cut it on some 5mm laser ply at the institute of making over in UCL. I think it came out pretty well, I&#8217;m going to make a few little tweaks, such as:

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8211; South Africa is a little flat on the bottom
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8211; Give New Zealand a little more love
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8211; Canada/Greenland boundary needs cleaning up
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The holes &#8220;lasered&#8221; really well, sometimes you need to poke out some of the stubborn bits. A bonus of this is that all the circles cutout where left on the &#8220;laser&#8221; bed when I lifted out the cut. It made for a nicer picture than the original!

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I put all the circles in a jar, I think I have an oncoming hoarding problem. Anywho&#8230; I have to find the link to the inspiration to this, it will come along in an edit. It was a guy I saw on Reddit that did something not a million miles away on a plank of Oak with a drill. Different vibe but I thought I would give him his props.
