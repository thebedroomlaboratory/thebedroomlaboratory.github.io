I've been looking for a new desk for a while, moving around a lot tends to leave you with tiny desks that can be moved from apartment to apartment. I couldn't find anything that wasn't crazy expensive so I thought I'd just build one myself. I had a couple of design features I wanted to include:

- Area to integrate my PC
  
- Storage for laptop
  
- Large area for working + PC screen etc...
  
- Some sort of whiteboard
  
- Lamp with magnifier

I saw a couple of cool desk designs I wanted to work around:

I can't remember where I saw this but if anyone knows please let me know and I'll link it!
  
I really like the idea that you can write directly onto your desk, you can do lovely doodles for projects directly onto your writing surface. There's a nice kind of reversion thing going on there, turning the youthful rebellion of defacing school material into a useful tool really appeals to me!

The second one I saw was from this blog:

Here is what I ended up with:

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-183" alt="IMG_20120717_225109" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_20120717_225109-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" />](/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_20120717_225109.jpg)

It turned out pretty well I think, there's a couple of more thing I want to do with it:

- I want to add the whiteboard material, I've a few options for this that I want to test
  
- Varnish the wood, its nice at the minute (has that lovely wood smell) but its going to stain with use

Finally once the whiteboard material is in I've an idea I want to get up and running. I want to attach a webcam to the lamp, then I can take photos of the lists, diagrams and such and store them to the PC. I'll probably need a script of some sort on the computer to take a photo and store it.

Will update soon peeps with more photos and the whiteboard bits!
