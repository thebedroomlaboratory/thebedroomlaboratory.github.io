A goal I set myself when I decided to get into the open source, hardware design, hacking world was to build as many of my tools as I could myself. Part of this is purely for cost reasons, mainly it is due to the fact that the more of a tool or design you put together yourself the more you'll understand how it all works! It also has the nice benefit of being able to expand on projects to add new features as they are needed.

So to this end, one of the first projects I decided to do would be to put together a reflow soldering oven. I spotted a cheap 900W toaster oven in aldi and started from there. Im putting together the full documentation for the projects section, it should hopefully make for an interesting (and more importantly) informative read
