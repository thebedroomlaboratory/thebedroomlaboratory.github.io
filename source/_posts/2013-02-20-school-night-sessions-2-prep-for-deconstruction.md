In advance of the upcoming competition being run by TheDeconstruction.org, we&#8217;re taking tonight&#8217;s School Night Session as an evening of preparation. The competition kicks off for real on Saturday morning at 1AM with us (5PM PST) but with shops not open at that time, we want to get a store of electronic parts etc. sorted out now. We also want to make some last minute improvements to our social media accounts and make sure this site is looking the way we want it to. If you have any suggestions for us, comment below or tweet us @bedlab. We&#8217;ll keep you posted as we go along.

# **UpdateÂ **

Finished the schedule for the weekend. Ended up not ordering the parts as we thought that working with what we have on the night when we decide a topic would be more aligned with the deconstruction theme! So we each have a box of components that we&#8217;ll try to make something fun out of!

This event has taken a lot of our time to setup so from next week we&#8217;ll resume the 3 hour designs!
