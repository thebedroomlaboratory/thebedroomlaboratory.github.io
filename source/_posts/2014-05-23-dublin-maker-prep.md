  Hello gentle viewer,
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Apologies for the brief sabbatical, I'm sure you've all been eagerly checking the website every day and been bitterly disappointed. Thankfully your days of sitting in with a glass of pinot noir on a lonely friday evening wearing away the lettering of your F5 key are over, we are back!
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We had our first meeting for the Dublin Maker event in July and I must say we are very excited. Last year we showed some of our homebrew solutions to... residential automation using various sensor and microcontroller bits and bobs.
</p>

_Weren't we lovely!_

Anywho so we don't want to give everything away but we have a plan. It is displayed here in stunning pictorial form:

We've broken down the tasks into the following:

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Smart Powerstrip - smart power strip that lets us control our devices over the web and see how much power they're using, cool eh. Victor &#8220;I love databases&#8221; Muia and Martin &#8220;current is cool&#8221; Kennedy will be plugging away at this.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Wireless Sensors - extending our sensor bits using low power wireless and have them talk to a Galileo which will act as a gateway for the home automation system. Martin &#8220;ZigBee is for wimps&#8221; Kennedy and Greg &#8220;I work for Intel now&#8221; Jackson will be having a go at that.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Rasp Pi cam - Looking at doing image/face detection using a Pi and Pi camera, could stream to android phone and be used for security or to dynamically adjust the feel of a house to the users mood. Colin &#8220;I'm just happy to be here&#8221; Greene will be selfie-ing himself for the sake of science for the foreseeable future.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Finally we will have a server that will manage the data and make the different parts of the system talk to each other and a web app with whopper user experience to let people use all this kit in an intuitive way. John &#8220;AngularJawS&#8221; Maguire and Michael &#8220;Just Keano&#8221; Keane will be knocking this one out of the park.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  So that's us. Stay tuned people, same bed time same bed channel!
