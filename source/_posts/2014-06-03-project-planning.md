Every Tuesday for the last few months we have been meeting up to have a quick scrum meeting. A &#8220;School Night Scrum&#8221;, you could say. We use this for keeping on top of what we&#8217;re all up to and to plan out our future projects. After getting our notification of acceptance, today&#8217;s session dealt entirely with our [Dublin Maker](http://www.dublinmaker.ie/ "Dublin Maker") project. Exciting and busy times ahead!

First on tonight&#8217;s agenda was planning a hacking day for kick-starting work on our project. There are a few of us involved in the Dublin Maker preparations so we started by making up a quick doodle to get a date that suits us all.

After that we proceeded to flesh out each of the project components a bit more in Github. We&#8217;ve setup a repository for all our code and design files for Dublin Maker and described each aspect of the project as issues in this repository:
  
Break down [issues](https://github.com/thebedroomlaboratory/Maker2014/issues) into tasks, using the [nested task list feature](https://github.com/blog/1841-nested-task-lists)

  * John Maguire &#8211; [Server](https://github.com/thebedroomlaboratory/Maker2014/issues/4)
  * John Maguire &#8211; [Web Application](https://github.com/thebedroomlaboratory/Maker2014/issues/5)
  * Victor &#8211; [Power Strip](https://github.com/thebedroomlaboratory/Maker2014/issues/6)
  * Martin &#8211; [Wireless Sensors](https://github.com/thebedroomlaboratory/Maker2014/issues/1)
  * Victor &#8211; [Intel Galileo Gateway](https://github.com/thebedroomlaboratory/Maker2014/issues/3)
  * Martin &#8211; [Raspberry Pi Cam](https://github.com/thebedroomlaboratory/Maker2014/issues/2)

Finally we started talking about topics we&#8217;d like to write posts for this website on over the next couple of weeks. The website needs a good overhaul but even getting it up to date would make a huge difference.

  * Martin &#8211; Python Threading and Queueing
  * Victor &#8211; Open Source Continuous Integration(CI)
  * The rest need to get the thinking caps on

That&#8217;s it for tonight. More updates to follow.
