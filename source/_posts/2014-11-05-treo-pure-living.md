We had an amazing time at the <a href="http://hwhackathon.com/" target="_blank">hardware hackathon, </a>leading up to the <a href="http://websummit.net/" target="_blank">Web Summit. </a>Thank you to all the <a href="http://hwhackathon.com/grid/sponsors/" target="_blank">sponsors </a>and participants for making it an unforgettable event.

Team Breazy <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ck2WPpjhfRc7YjB8PuCylrqnFgSW-o-YzoPbFjmE4Y8/edit?pli=1#slide=id.p" target="_blank">presented Treo,</a> the route to healthy living. A personal pollution exposure monitor, that empowers us to make smarter and better decisions, leading to a healthier lifestyle.

The solution, made available on <a href="https://github.com/catchmartin/Breazy" target="_blank">github</a>., comprised:

  * A wearable device and docking station designed in <a href="https://360.autodesk.com/Login" target="_blank">AutoDesk</a> and delivered as 3D-Printed and Lazer Cut models.
  * An <a href="http://electricimp.com/" target="_blank">Electric Imp</a> engine running the docking station and <a href="http://redbearlab.com/" target="_blank">RedBearLab Micro</a> brains inside the wearable.
  * TheÂ server receiving, processing and serving the information stored in a <a href="https://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDb</a> database was built on <a href="http://nodered.org/" target="_blank">Node-RED</a>.
  * Finally a Mobile App built on the <a href="http://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank">Ionic framework</a> presented the analysis and provided suggestions for a healthier lifestyle.

The most notable improvement from the previous hardware hackathon was the addition of a strong design element, which enhanced the form to follow the hardware functionality.

In that spirit we&#8217;d like to thank Meadhbh, Alan and Tom; the design leads; for ensuring the product came to life. Hendrik; the business lead; who put the commercial viability into the plan. The hardware leads; Jason, Conor and Greg; for producing functional prototypes. And the software leads, Victor and Martin, who delivered the mobile application and web service behind the product.

Congratulations to the winners Cash-up and here&#8217;s looking forward to the next hwhackathon and TechShop Ireland.
