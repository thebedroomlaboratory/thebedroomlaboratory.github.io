The <a href="https://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/hoc/" target="_blank">hour of code</a> sessions at  <a href="http://tulach.ie/" target="_blank">Gaelscoil Thulach na nÓg</a> were a great success last week. Students and facilitators alike had great fun. Students learnt and taught each other a great deal about coding and produced wonderful festive greeting cards.

Originally the plan by <span style="font-size: medium;">Pól,  Bernie and Fiona - the session facilitators  - was to introduce the students to coding via the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/test-tims-nuscratch-beta/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi Scratch</a> environment. Giving the students a feel for both the electronics and software aspects of coding. However, due to time constraints, the sessions were focused on creating a festive greeting card using <a href="https://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/hoc/" target="_blank">Scratch</a>.</span>

Some of the inspiring creations exhibited included: Santa bouncing on a trampoline - presents flying out of his sack - as he bid the viewer &#8220;Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas&#8221;, Ice skating reindeer and Dublin City sleigh rides.

Hopefully we will be back gain soon to build on those sessions, maybe adding <span style="font-size: medium;"><a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/test-tims-nuscratch-beta/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi Scratch</a></span> or <a href="http://s4a.cat/" target="_blank">Arduino Scratch </a>elements to the amazing greeting cards already created.

Nollaig Shona!
