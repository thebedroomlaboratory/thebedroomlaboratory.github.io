I&#8217;ve been looking for a new desk for a while, moving around a lot tends to leave you with tiny desks that can be moved from apartment to apartment. I couldn&#8217;t find anything that wasn&#8217;t crazy expensive so I thought I&#8217;d just build one myself. I had a couple of design features I wanted to include:

&#8211; Area to integrate my PC
  
&#8211; Storage for laptop
  
&#8211; Large area for working + PC screen etc&#8230;
  
&#8211; Some sort of whiteboard
  
&#8211; Lamp with magnifier

I saw a couple of cool desk designs I wanted to work around:

I can&#8217;t remember where I saw this but if anyone knows please let me know and I&#8217;ll link it!
  
I really like the idea that you can write directly onto your desk, you can do lovely doodles for projects directly onto your writing surface. There&#8217;s a nice kind of reversion thing going on there, turning the youthful rebellion of defacing school material into a useful tool really appeals to me!

The second one I saw was from this blog:

Here is what I ended up with:

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-183" alt="IMG_20120717_225109" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_20120717_225109-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" />](/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_20120717_225109.jpg)

It turned out pretty well I think, there&#8217;s a couple of more thing I want to do with it:

&#8211; I want to add the whiteboard material, I&#8217;ve a few options for this that I want to test
  
&#8211; Varnish the wood, its nice at the minute (has that lovely wood smell) but its going to stain with use

Finally once the whiteboard material is in I&#8217;ve an idea I want to get up and running. I want to attach a webcam to the lamp, then I can take photos of the lists, diagrams and such and store them to the PC. I&#8217;ll probably need a script of some sort on the computer to take a photo and store it.

Will update soon peeps with more photos and the whiteboard bits!
