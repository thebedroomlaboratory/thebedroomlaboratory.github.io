We had an amazing time at the [sponsors ](http://hwhackathon.com/)and participants for making it an unforgettable event.

Team Breazy [presented Treo,](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ck2WPpjhfRc7YjB8PuCylrqnFgSW-o-YzoPbFjmE4Y8/edit?pli=1#slide=id.p) the route to healthy living. A personal pollution exposure monitor, that empowers us to make smarter and better decisions, leading to a healthier lifestyle.

The solution, made available on [github](https://github.com/catchmartin/Breazy)., comprised:

  * A wearable device and docking station designed in [AutoDesk](https://360.autodesk.com/Login) and delivered as 3D-Printed and Lazer Cut models.
  * An [RedBearLab Micro](http://electricimp.com/) brains inside the wearable.
  * TheÂ server receiving, processing and serving the information stored in a [Node-RED](https://www.mongodb.org/).
  * Finally a Mobile App built on the [Ionic framework](http://ionicframework.com/) presented the analysis and provided suggestions for a healthier lifestyle.

The most notable improvement from the previous hardware hackathon was the addition of a strong design element, which enhanced the form to follow the hardware functionality.

In that spirit we'd like to thank Meadhbh, Alan and Tom; the design leads; for ensuring the product came to life. Hendrik; the business lead; who put the commercial viability into the plan. The hardware leads; Jason, Conor and Greg; for producing functional prototypes. And the software leads, Victor and Martin, who delivered the mobile application and web service behind the product.

Congratulations to the winners Cash-up and here's looking forward to the next hwhackathon and TechShop Ireland. ![Treo_Design](/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Treo_Docking_Station-225x300.jpg)
