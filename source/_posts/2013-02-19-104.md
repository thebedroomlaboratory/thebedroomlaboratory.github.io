We&#8217;re both looking forward to taking part in the deconstruction 2013 event. We&#8217;ve roped a few friends in to make it more fun and to have some more varied skills on the day! This is our first time doing something like this so our main goal will be to learn and meet some interesting, likeminded people. We&#8217;re not shouting from the roof top that we&#8217;ll win but hopefully we&#8217;ll have created something useful and different by the end of the 2 days. Sure who doesn&#8217;t want a laser cutter!!!

We&#8217;ll we putting updates as we go, we are currently putting together a schedule of events for the live stream of what we&#8217;ll be doing which will include:

&#8211; How to [sessions]
  
&#8211; Interview with a [nerdy engineering guy]
  
&#8211; Failed world record attempts
