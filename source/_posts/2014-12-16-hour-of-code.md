The [Gaelscoil Thulach na nÓg](https://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/hoc/) were a great success last week. Students and facilitators alike had great fun. Students learnt and taught each other a great deal about coding and produced wonderful festive greeting cards.

Originally the plan by <span style="font-size: medium;">Pól,  Bernie and Fiona - the session facilitators  - was to introduce the students to coding via the [Scratch](http://www.raspberrypi.org/test-tims-nuscratch-beta/).</span>

Some of the inspiring creations exhibited included: Santa bouncing on a trampoline - presents flying out of his sack - as he bid the viewer &#8220;Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas&#8221;, Ice skating reindeer and Dublin City sleigh rides.

Hopefully we will be back gain soon to build on those sessions, maybe adding <span style="font-size: medium;">[Arduino Scratch ](http://www.raspberrypi.org/test-tims-nuscratch-beta/)elements to the amazing greeting cards already created.

Nollaig Shona!
